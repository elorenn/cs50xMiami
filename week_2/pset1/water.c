/* 
a program that prompts the user for the length of his or her shower in minutes (as a positive integer) 
and then prints the equivalent number of bottles of water (as an integer) per the sample output below, 
wherein underlined text represents some user’s input.
For simplicity, you may assume that the user will input a positive integer, so no need for error-checking
(or any loops) this time! And no need to worry about overflow!

minutes: 10
bottles: 120

And if you’d like to play with the staff’s own implementation of water within CS50 IDE, you may execute the below:
~cs50/pset1/water
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main( ) {
    
    printf( "minutes: ");
    // string str = GetString();
    // printf("Select (U)pper, (L)ower, or (S)wap case: ");
    // char selection = GetChar();
    

    return 0; // good practice to include this for feedback
}
